# APP - Fisio Evolui

I developed this APP with a focus on patient management and care for physiotherapists, but since I decided to start from scratch, using the main market methodologies, such as TDD and Factory, in addition to performing automated tests, I decided to make this api publicly available, as I will not more use it
